# Video Landing Page

This is a Responsive website that runs a background video on the front page.

It has been built using [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx_7GQtSdpc) by Brad Traversy.

Minor changes have been made to use modern solutions for displaying the background video and making it responsive.

The site is currently deployed on GitHub pages and can be viewed [here](https://tankris.github.io/Video-Landing-Page).

### Sincere thanks to
